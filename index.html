			<h2>Brief Synopsis of Self</h2>
			<section>
			<p>Born in southern Connecticut, I am privileged to have had an idyllic childhood. While in middle school, the, <i>not-so-idyllic</i>, pubescent years, my dad was called to a church in northern Virginia. Having met at HDS, both my parents are ordained ministers...a fact which has not been impactful to my identity whatsoever. <i>I kid</i>. I became a product of FCPS, and applied, early-decision, to <b>Elon University</b>. Learning of my admission in November, 2013, while stressful, was also <i>freeing</i>, as I had determined the location of my continued education. Recruited by Teach for America, during the fall of 2017, I was relieved, as, despite several internships, the interdisciplinary nature of <b>public health</b> was not especially promising, as far as immediate employment. During the summer of 2018, it became clear that life's season would not allow me to give my all to teaching. I applied to two other jobs, and chose to work at Mason. A <i>happy fact</i>: I met my husband at the age of 15. We dated throughout high school and college, and were married in November, 2018. Marriage is a gift. A <i>sad fact</i>: In a matter of two weeks, on July 18th, 2019, my dad, who exercised more than I, died. The loss is excruciating. <i>Grief is non-linear</i>. My (only) sister is 17. In other, <i>more trivial</i>, news, I enjoy cultivating -- communicating, verbally (orating, writing, singing, etc.) and nonverbally (dancing, painting, sketching, etc.), hiking, and home-making. I have an affinity for wicker and dried flowers. <i>I am wary of stagnancy</i>. 2019 and 2020 have certainly allowed for growth.</section></p>
