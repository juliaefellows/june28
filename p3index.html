						<p><i>proximity breeds empathy</i>. in the context of global suffering, much of life is trivial. for much of my life, my earnest desire <i>"to help,"</i> aligned with the white savior complex, much to my unawareness. i still desire to advocate for the oppressed, while <i>mindful</i> of the truths of <b>"othering"</b> ('the,' 'them,' 'they,' etc.), and literature such as "Toxic Charity," "Dead Aid," "The New Jim Crow," "Evicted," "The Other Wes Moore," "Just Mercy," and so many more. a brief excerpt of a journal entry, <i>"India, I will miss your precious children who led me along slum pathways, enlightening me to a disposition and lifestyle of joy not heartache. i will miss the melodies of your culture...horn banter, lush greens, gentle chants, and fuchsia sarees. i will miss the raw beauty of un-institutionalized maternal care. i will miss your country and your people."</i></p>
						
						<p>cultivate</p>
						
						<p>life’s fragility has been divisive...polarizing,  even...in my stream (?) of consciousness</p>
						
						<p>anxiety and its depressive partner pulsate the chest...the body bending under their weight</P>
						<p>how frightening to be so helpless</p>
						<p>how Humbling to know one’s helplessness</p>
						<p>the gurney was grounding</p>
						<p>contrarily, clinging to cultivation</p>
						<p>a child’s wonderment and tender spirit</p>
						<p>a cardinal, fluttering its wings</p>
						<p>a propagated clipping, rooted and budding</p>
						<p>previously, a pasta sauce jar, now, a clothespins’ carrier</p>
						<p>new life</p>
						<p>new Life</p>
						<p>the extremes of fearing, due to fragility, while a consumed craving of earthbound new life</p>
						<p>had you not had new Life, would i be so keen to cultivate?</p>
						<p>would i realize cultivation is our essence?</p>
						<p>beginning in the Garden...</p>

							<p>born in southern Connecticut, I am privileged to have had an idyllic childhood. while in middle school, the, <i>not-so-idyllic</i>, pubescent years, my dad was called to a church in northern Virginia. having met at HDS, both my parents are ordained ministers...a fact which has not been impactful to my identity whatsoever. <i>i kid</i>. i became a product of FCPS, and applied, early-decision, to <b>Elon University</b>. learning of my admission in November, 2013, while stressful, was also <i>freeing</i>, as I had determined the location of my continued education. recruited by Teach for America, during the fall of 2017, I was relieved, as, despite several internships, the interdisciplinary nature of <b>public health</b> was not especially promising, as far as immediate employment. during the summer of 2018, it became clear that life's season would not allow me to give my all to teaching. i applied to two other jobs, and chose to work at Mason. a <i>happy fact</i>: i met my husband at the age of 15. we dated throughout high school and college, and were married in November, 2018. Marriage is a gift. A <i>sad fact</i>: In a matter of two weeks, on July 18th, 2019, my dad, who exercised more than i, died. the loss is excruciating. <i>grief is non-linear</i>. my (only) sister is 17. in other, <i>more trivial</i>, news, I enjoy cultivating -- communicating, verbally (orating, writing, singing, etc.) and nonverbally (dancing, painting, sketching, etc.), hiking, and home-making. i have an affinity for wicker and dried flowers. <i>i am wary of stagnancy</i>. 2019 and 2020 have certainly allowed for growth.</section></p>
