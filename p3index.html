						<p><i>proximity breeds empathy</i>. in the context of global suffering, much of life is trivial. for much of my life, my earnest desire <i>"to help,"</i> aligned with the white savior complex, much to my unawareness. i still desire to advocate for the oppressed, while <i>mindful</i> of the truths of <b>"othering"</b> ('the,' 'them,' 'they,' etc.), and literature such as "Toxic Charity," "Dead Aid," "The New Jim Crow," "Evicted," "The Other Wes Moore," "Just Mercy," and so many more. so while me, pointing to the branding of "IJM" and "United Way," is trivial, relatively speaking, the placement of these images has served as practice. this photo was taken in Jamkhed, India, where I completed a public health practicum. a brief excerpt of a journal entry, <i>"India, I will miss your precious children who led me along slum pathways, enlightening me to a disposition and lifestyle of joy not heartache. i will miss the melodies of your culture...horn banter, lush greens, gentle chants, and fuchsia sarees. i will miss the raw beauty of un-institutionalized maternal care. i will miss your country and your people."</i></p>

								<h2>who</h2>
							</header>

							<p>born in southern Connecticut, I am privileged to have had an idyllic childhood. while in middle school, the, <i>not-so-idyllic</i>, pubescent years, my dad was called to a church in northern Virginia. having met at HDS, both my parents are ordained ministers...a fact which has not been impactful to my identity whatsoever. <i>i kid</i>. i became a product of FCPS, and applied, early-decision, to <b>Elon University</b>. learning of my admission in November, 2013, while stressful, was also <i>freeing</i>, as I had determined the location of my continued education. recruited by Teach for America, during the fall of 2017, I was relieved, as, despite several internships, the interdisciplinary nature of <b>public health</b> was not especially promising, as far as immediate employment. during the summer of 2018, it became clear that life's season would not allow me to give my all to teaching. i applied to two other jobs, and chose to work at Mason. a <i>happy fact</i>: i met my husband at the age of 15. we dated throughout high school and college, and were married in November, 2018. Marriage is a gift. A <i>sad fact</i>: In a matter of two weeks, on July 18th, 2019, my dad, who exercised more than i, died. the loss is excruciating. <i>grief is non-linear</i>. my (only) sister is 17. in other, <i>more trivial</i>, news, I enjoy cultivating -- communicating, verbally (orating, writing, singing, etc.) and nonverbally (dancing, painting, sketching, etc.), hiking, and home-making. i have an affinity for wicker and dried flowers. <i>i am wary of stagnancy</i>. 2019 and 2020 have certainly allowed for growth.</section></p>
